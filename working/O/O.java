	O. (If you want) Rewrite the above code so that your "unverified block receiving server"
	acts as a producer process and you have a separate thread that acts as a consumer that
	pops off the blocks and writes the names of each patient on the console. In this version
	it is possible that the order of the patient names will be different on the different
	consoles, depending on what gets popped when, and what gets recieved when.
