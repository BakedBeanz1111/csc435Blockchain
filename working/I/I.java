/*
	I. Write a standalone program that implements your (sleep-enhanced
	work algorithm. Note that this alrogithm should do real work, but
	make it a very easy puzzle and then add a sleep statement to fake
	making it harder. E.g.: you can solve the puzzle one time in three
	on average, but you sleep one second each time. Add some comments
	about how you would make the work harder if you wanted to. Combine
	this with your blockchain code from [A] above so that you actually
	produce a hash value of your block and verify the block using your
	work . Create a full blockchain of four or five blocks with hard-coded
	fake data, but which has verified blocks in it.
